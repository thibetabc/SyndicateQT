Use this instruction and the youtube video to install the wallet, fix wallet issues and setup one/multiple masternode(s).
This guide is for the creation of separate Controller Wallet & Masternode.
For Security reasons, THIS IS THE PREFERRED way to run a Masternode. By running your Masternode in this way you are protecting
your coins in your private wallet, and are not required to have your local wallet running after the Masternode has been started successfully.
Your coins will be safe if the masternode server gets hacked.

	- Note: You can't edit the masternodes config in the wallet but you can edit the file. `%appdata%/Syndicate/masternode.conf`.

## 3. FAQ

1. What if I restart the server?
	- The script setup a cron job so the masternode automaticly starts every time when the vps turns on.
1. How to get masternode profit?
	- Enable coin controll feature (Settings => Options => Display => Display coin controll feature)
	- Go send tab
	- Select from the input button only the 5 coin lines
	- Click OK
	- You can send selected amount to an address.
	- Note: DO NOT EVER Transfer synx from that original 5k deposit or you'll break your Masternode.
1. What is the password for the mn1, mn2, ...mnX accounts?
	- There is no default password. When you create a user it does not have a password yet, so you cannot login with that username until you create a password. There is one other way to act as a new user without its password. As root type `su - mn1`
	- You need to set a password for the user. Use the passwd command: `passwd mn1`
1. I get the following error: "Could not allocate vin"
	- Make sure your wallet fully synced and UNLOCKED.
1. How many masternodes can I run using one IP/server?
	- The limit is only the memory. One masternode requires 300-400mb ram. A server with 1GB memory can run 3 masternodes.
1. My wallet says my masternodes are not running.
	- The wallet will tell you its not running sometimes when it is. If you still receving the masternode rewards then everything is fine.

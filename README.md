## WalleQt

First and foremost, we have the pleasure to announce that due to intense work and outstanding support from the community, Walle coin has been saved, and from now on, things will only get better.
We would like to officially thank the past developers for their significant work with Walle. 
They managed to place us in a right strategic direction, leaving a legacy of high paying Masternodes and POS rewards, but now, it is the time for the community to move forward.


As we highly believe in the voice of the community we created the “Governance Platform” the place where people can vote for future projects. The platform will enable us to address the community future projects and simultaneously raise funds. 

As we also know that you like good news, we’re pleased to announce that the platform is live and operational and can be found at: www.walleltd.net


### GOVERNANCE PLATFORM 

There are some facts you need to know before voting: 

The most important thing that you should know is that received SYNX from voters will not be staked to influence the network, in fact staking rewards will 
significantly increase, by dramatically lowering the network weight

Voting ends when the first project receives the minimum amount of votes votes

SYNX can be sent from anywhere (wallet or exchange)

There is no minimum amount to send

Always save a proof of your vote (TX-id) for future benefits & clarifications

Project developing will start as soon as it reaches the minimum amount required (see the bluepaper)

Deadline countdown begins at the end of the voting period

If one of the projects will not raise enough votes to pass the requirement amount, 50% of the coins from the voters will be burned to support SYNX deflation and the other 50% percent will be reserved for community and team (New hires, Marketing, Salaries, Equipment, Graphic Design and Future Community bounties: Twitter, Bitcointalk, Bug Fixes)

The winning project will receive a detailed Whitepaper, max 2 weeks after voting ends

Detailed aspects about projects + newsletter can be found in the Bluepaper below
